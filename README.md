Multi-Protocol Support: MQTT, REST API, and Bluetooth Integration
The foundation of MQTTfy’s power lies in its comprehensive protocol support. The platform connects to MQTT brokers using industry-standard connections, supporting all three Quality of Service ([QoS](https://mqtt-ble.com)) levels — QoS 0 (at most once), QoS 1 (at least once), and QoS 2 (exactly once) — ensuring reliable message delivery based on application requirements.​

## For REST API integration, MQTTfy enables seamless data exchange between web services and IoT devices. This bidirectional communication allows the central dashboard to send control commands through REST API interfaces while receiving real-time data through MQTT protocols. This hybrid approach combines the real-time performance of MQTT with the flexibility and wide compatibility of REST APIs.​

## What truly sets MQTTfy apart is its implementation of the Web Bluetooth API for direct browser-to-device communication. Through Web Bluetooth integration, users can connect to Bluetooth Low Energy devices directly from their web browser without requiring native applications or plugins. This capability is transformative for smart home automation, enabling users to control lights, thermostats, door locks, and security systems directly from the dashboard.​

The Web Bluetooth API works through a discovery process that identifies available BLE devices and services, then provides access to the GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) for reading and writing data to device characteristics. MQTTfy leverages this technology to create a seamless experience where users can scan for nearby devices, establish secure connections, and control them — all within a single dashboard interface.​

One of MQTTfy’s most innovative features is its integration of the Web Bluetooth API for smart home automation. This technology represents a paradigm shift in how users interact with Bluetooth-enabled smart home devices.​

How Web Bluetooth Works in MQTTfy
The Web Bluetooth API is a JavaScript interface that enables web applications to discover, connect to, and communicate with Bluetooth Low Energy devices directly from a browser. The process works through several stages:​

Device Discovery: When a user initiates a connection, MQTTfy requests access to nearby Bluetooth devices using the navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice() method.​
User Authorization: The browser displays a native dialog allowing users to select which device to connect to, ensuring security and user consent.​
GATT Connection: Once authorized, the application establishes a GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) connection to access the device’s services and characteristics.​
Data Exchange: MQTTfy can then read sensor data, write control commands, and subscribe to real-time notifications from the device.​
All of this happens without requiring any native applications or plugins — users simply open the dashboard in a compatible browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera on desktop and Android).​

Smart Home Automation Use Cases
The Web Bluetooth integration in MQTTfy enables numerous smart home applications:
